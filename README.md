# Forked Academic Project

This repository is a fork of an academic project that was realized by a team of seven classmates, including myself. The original project aimed to develop a comprehensive healthcare management system. In this fork, I focused on implementing the video conferencing feature using Jitsi and integrating video calls using PeerJS. Additionally, I worked on the module responsible for managing patients' consultations, prescriptions, and medical test records.

## Project Overview

The original academic project aimed to create a comprehensive healthcare management system that would enable efficient management of patient records, appointments, prescriptions, and medical test results. The system aimed to streamline the workflow for healthcare professionals and improve patient care.

## Features Implemented

In this fork, my contributions focused on the following features:

- Video conferencing with Jitsi
- Video calls using PeerJS
- Patients consultation module (managing consultation files, prescriptions, and medical tests)

The following sections provide more details about each of these features and the work I have done.

## Video Conferencing with Jitsi

I integrated Jitsi, an open-source video conferencing solution, into the project. This feature allows healthcare professionals to conduct video conferences with patients or other healthcare providers. Jitsi provides a secure and reliable platform for real-time communication, enabling seamless remote consultations.

## Video Calls with PeerJS

I implemented video call functionality using PeerJS, a JavaScript library for WebRTC peer-to-peer communication. This feature enables healthcare professionals to conduct one-on-one video calls with patients, facilitating remote consultations and enhancing communication between healthcare providers and patients.

## Patients Consultation Module

I worked on the patients consultation module, which includes the following functionalities:

- Managing consultation files: Uploading and storing files related to patient consultations, such as medical reports, imaging results, and lab test reports.
- Prescriptions: Creating and managing prescriptions for patients, including medication details, dosage instructions, and duration.
- Medical tests: Recording and tracking medical tests requested for patients, including test type, date, and results.

This module aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing patients' medical records, consultations, and treatment plans within the healthcare management system.

## Contributions

In addition to my specific contributions mentioned above, I also collaborated with my teammates on various aspects of the project, including requirements gathering, database design, and user interface development. We followed an agile development approach, working together to ensure the successful completion of the project.

## Installation

- Clone Cloud9 Spring boot project found on my github profile
- Set up the needed Database and start the spring boot application
- Set up as a normal Angular Project
